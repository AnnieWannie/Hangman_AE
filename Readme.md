Hangman game created as my final project submission for Stanford's Code in Place 2021.

For those that do not know hangman is a word guessing game in which the user will guess a word letter by letter. Incorrect guesses will result in strikes.

The game was designed in Python3 and reads from a lexicon of 120,000 words. There is also a self contained word list within the code if a user does not
want to download the additional lexicon.txt file.
